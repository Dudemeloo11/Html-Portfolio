<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Andreas Krugu, a tech-driven student with a strong interest in software development, artificial intelligence, and entrepreneurship. I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, especially in areas like education, employment, and productivity.</p>
<p>I’m currently building my skills in full-stack web development, Python, and AI-powered applications, while actively exploring startup ideas and digital products that create value and generate sustainable income. I enjoy turning ideas into practical solutions and continuously learning through hands-on projects.</p>
<p>Beyond coding, I’m focused on personal growth, discipline, and long-term success—whether that’s through improving my technical skills, fitness, or business mindset. I believe in consistency, curiosity, and building things that matter.</p>
<p>My goal is to grow into a high-impact software engineer and tech entrepreneur, contributing to meaningful innovations both locally and globally.</p>
